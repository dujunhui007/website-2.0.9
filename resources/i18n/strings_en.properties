string_introductionTopContent=New Generation of Block Chain Application Development Platform Based on Side Chain Architecture
string_introductionContentTitleOne=ASCH is a new generation block chain innovation application development platform based on side chain structure which is efficient, flexible, safe, low-cost and reused
string_introductionContentOne=ASCH is a new generation block chain innovation application development platform based on side chain structure which is efficient, flexible, safe, low-cost and reused. With the use of JavaScript as its application programming language, the platform makes use of relational databases to store data, drawing similarities between developing a DAPP and developing a traditional web application. This type of platform carries a great deal of appeal to developers, as well as small and medium enterprises, since its ease of use results in greater productivity, fuelling and facilitating a more prosperous ecosystem in the process. ASCH is open in design and is not limited to any particular niche market such as news aggregation, the issue of assets, arbitration, the existence of certificate, property rights certification, the Internet of things, supply chain finance, asset digitization, commodity tracing, prepaid card system, block chain contract deposit etc. In terms of the consensus mechanism, ASCH has inherited and enhanced the DPOS algorithm, simultaneously reducing the probability of forking and double spending by a significant degree. Furthermore, ASCH’S side chain, i.e. the application mode, not only improves scalability by delaying the expansion of the block chain, but also makes DAPPS more flexible and personalized. ASCH is a forward-looking, low-cost and one-stop application solution, which is believed to be a new generation of incubator for decentralized applications. Adhering to the values of enterprise accomplishments, innovation leading, technology belief and embracing future, ASCH is devoted to building a global commercial block chain application ecosystem, which is not only using block chain technology to empower various industries, but also being the base of the world class economy.
string_introductionContentTitleTwo=The services provided by the ASCH platform include a public chain and a set of application SDKs
string_introductionContentTwo=The services provided by the ASCH platform include a public chain and a set of application SDKs; the public chain is called the main chain. The ASCH application SDKs can be used to develop blockchain applications with a free-running, immutable ledger. These applications are also known as side chain applications. An application SDK has a built-in cross-chain protocol, through which the side chain can communicate with the main chain. In other words, the main chain has the function of asset routing, through which a variety of assets can flow among different applications. ASCH’s ecological system contains multiple chains, with each chain possessing the ability to carry multiple tokens or assets. Each token or asset can also be transferred to multiple chains.

string_feature1=Features 01.
string_feature2=Features 02.
string_commonText1=New Generation of Block Chain Application Development Platform Based on Side Chain Architecture
string_featuresTopTitle=Public chain
string_featuresTopTitleContent=ASCH’s public chain is mainly responsible for data sharing between infrastructure and applications; it is also used for asset routing. The SDKs are responsible for building specific applications.

string_featuresTopTitle2=Application management
string_featuresTopTitleContent2=Applications need to register meta-information into the main chain before issued. The meta-information includes the name and description of the applications, the initial witnesses, and other relevant configuration information for the asset routing. Users can browse, retrieve, trace, download and visit decentralized applications through the module.
string_featuresTopTitle3=Asset routing
string_featuresTopTitleContent3=The assets registered on the main-chain can communicate with each application via cross-chain. Although applications are separated from each other, the flow of value could be realized through the asset routing function of the main chain.
string_featuresTopTitle4=Asset management
string_featuresTopTitleContent4=Any accounts can register and issue multiple assets, and the issuer can configure the assets in various ways, for example, through the use of an access control list.
string_featuresTopTitle5=Delegate management
string_featuresTopTitleContent5=Each account with tokens on the ASCH main-chain can be registered as a delegate, which is also known as a "witness". The top 101 delegates are given the opportunity and responsibility of being the system’s account keepers, including the right to forging (or mining, accounting and generating blocks) which results in the reward of a certain amount of tokens. The account keepers can be promoted via the vote of the token holders, who are able to vote for any delegates, to raise their ranking.
string_featuresTopTitle6=Account management
string_featuresTopTitleContent6=The account model is adopted at the lower level of ASCH chain. Each private key corresponds to an account in which the basic user information such as the wallet address, public key, nickname, as well as other configuration information or statistical information is stored. As all application chains use the same account model, an account on the ASCH chain is able to use the functions of all applications directly.

string_featuresTopTitle7=SDK
string_featuresTopTitleContent7=ASCH’s public chain is mainly responsible for data sharing between infrastructure and applications; it is also used for asset routing. The SDKs are responsible for building specific applications.
string_featuresTopTitle8=ORM
string_featuresTopTitleContent8=Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) can support relational mapping of objects to organize business data, and support index allocation, whilst complex searches can be realized with the JSON language.
string_featuresTopTitle9=JavaScript
string_featuresTopTitleContent9=Developers can utilize and combine huge amounts of third-party components freely by using JavaScript as the native language.
string_featuresTopTitle10=Two-way peg cross-chain protocol
string_featuresTopTitleContent10=Cross-chain protocol supporting two-way peg.
string_featuresTopTitle11=Immutable ledger
string_featuresTopTitleContent11=An immutable ledger is built in with the account setup function. All invoking operations and statuses will be written into the immutable ledger when developers and users invoke a chain code function.
string_featuresTopTitle12=Lower level interfaces
string_featuresTopTitleContent12=In comparison to the Solidity language of Ethereum, ASCH allows developers to use underlying APIs so as to gain maximum control of the whole system, examples including the handler and filter of every cycle time event.
string_featuresTopTitle13=Customize fee definitions
string_featuresTopTitleContent13=Developers can set up different service charges for every event or chain code, and even can set up different asset tokens aside from XAS as service charge.
string_featuresTopTitle14=Transaction privacy
string_featuresTopTitleContent14=The feature of optional transaction privacy.
string_featuresTopTitle15=SmartDB
string_featuresTopTitleContent15=Cache and persistent data storage can be synchronized automatically to greatly improve writing performance.

string_AdvantagesTitle=Advantages

string_advantages1=Low Cost
string_advantagesContent1=Developers can customize a gas token, which can effectively control operation costs.
string_advantages2=Safety
string_advantagesContent2= PBFT enhanced DPOS. Multi-level payment passwords. Applications are isolated to prevent error spreading. Sandbox mechanism can manage untrusted code.
string_advantages3=Reuseability
string_advantagesContent3=Applications can share data on ASCH platform. Furthermore, they can reuse assets on different blockchains.
string_advantages4=Flexibility
string_advantagesContent4=Assets and applications are decoupled. One token can be used on multi-chains, and one chain can hold multiple tokens.
string_advantages5=Usability
string_advantagesContent5=Based on JavaScript stack,SDK supports advanced features like ORM、SmartDB etc that make DAPP development more easier.
string_advantages6=Performance
string_advantagesContent6=More than 1500 transactions per second, performance is scalable by fragment and parallel.

string_scenariosTitle=Scenarios
string_scenariosTitle1=The ASCH platform can be applied to the following application scenarios, but is not limited to them.
string_scenariosTitle2=Content publishing platform
string_scenariosDescribe2=Key words: token incentive, value transfer, group wisdom
string_scenariosContent2=On the internet, large enterprises deliver content which users are interested in by analyzing their reading habits, thus enabling them to capitalize on their behaviour. At the same time, the algorithm also creates a niche, which deprives users of their rights to choose and recognize. However,through the use of the decentralization feature of the blockchain, the most interesting news in the community can be selected through the help of the group wisdom of the users. Meanwhile, the token incentive mechanism can be applied since its economic mechanism is able to stimulate the participants’ enthusiasm. This solves the problem that quality content is difficult to be identified and realized. The value will therefore return to its creators and deliverers, allowing it to be shared by all participants.
string_scenariosTitle3=Market prediction
string_scenariosDescribe3=Key words: token incentive, value transfer, public participation
string_scenariosContent3=Market prediction is the collection of indicators of confidence and judgment from different parties regarding the same topic, based on market principles, so as to predict the future result of an event. The blockchain is distributed, open, transparent and immutable. We believe that it is able to solve the issue of insufficient credibility which exists in traditional prediction platforms. This solution establishes a credible, autonomous, value-transitive and extensible platform for market prediction. The platform will be able to predict upcoming events with the aid of senior wisdom derived from large-scale co-operation, attracting more people to participate in the process by utilizing the built-in token incentive.
string_scenariosTitle4=Exchange platform
string_scenariosDescribe4=Key words: safety, decentralization, low fee, anonymity, scalability
string_scenariosContent4=The exchange platform, which is based on distributed blockchain technology, is an important part of ASCH’s ecology. ASCH represents a new generation of blockchain application development  platforms, based on side chain technology. On the platform, a number of excellent projects and many different types of tokens will be created and developed. At this moment in time, the system and functionality of the exchange platform represents the basic demands of many users, since it includes a wide array of features such as decentralization, disintermediation, safety, low fees, anonymity,and scalability, which other exchange platforms do not have. With side chain technology, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other high-quality projects can become interconnected, allowing streamlined circulation of digital assets, whilst eliminating isolation amongst them.
string_scenariosTitle5=Social media
string_scenariosDescribe5=Key words: value network, data private
string_scenariosContent5=Internet-based social media companies plunder data produced by users and unilaterally consume users through protocols which users are forced to comply with. Users are not able to fully enjoy the benefits of creating, establishing and maintaining their own community. As a result, social media based on the main-chain distributed technology is a trend of future development. With the decentralization feature of the blockchain, it is able to achieve data and value freedom. Furthermore, through the use of the built-in token mechanism,a complete and positive-feedback value incentive economic system will be established so as to promote the development of the entire ecosystem.
string_scenariosTitle6=IP Copyright protection
string_scenariosDescribe6=Key words: tractability, value incentive
string_scenariosContent6=The popularity of the IP economy has made many peopole aware of the importance of IP, and IP mostly comes from literary works, which highlights the importance of copyright. The biggest difficulty of copyright protection is to collect evidence in circulation. Circulation is uncontrollable, so comprehensive protection of copyright cannot be assured. Blockchain technology is able to greatly  reduce piracy, by providing protection to the entire ecosystem in the form of copyright which features traceability and immutability. The rights in the process of creation can be simultaneously and permanently stored in the blockchain，creating evidence for future potential disputes to be resolved easily.
string_scenariosTitle7=Public donation
string_scenariosDescribe7=Key words: transparency, safety, decentralization
string_scenariosContent7=The essence of public donations is a process of social wealth redistribution. The goal, amount and execution of wealth redistribution are determined by public organizations. Nowadays, the biggest contradiction in the public welfare field is the demand for public donations and the loss of non-profit organizations’ credibility. The inherent features of decentralization, transparency and immutability of the blockchain make the acceptance, donations and all other operations inherently exposed to the public, breaking any distrust between donors and executors.

string_getStartedText34=Backup the main password,Start using it.
string_getStartedText35=Ways to get XAS
string_getStartedText36=The token on ASCH main chain is ASCH coin (XAS). XAS  is mainly used for transferring, registering assets, registering trustees, voting and other operations on the main chain. The main ways of gaining XAS are as follow:
string_getStartedText37=1.Exchanges: check the exchanges which support trading XAS on the home page(https://asch.io).
string_getStartedText38=2.Get from curb exchanges or friends.
string_getStartedText39=3.Pay attention to the social media on the home page (https://asch.io), and participate in the irregular activities held by ASCH.
string_getStartedText40=4.Participate in the construction of ASCH community, and get rewards.
string_getStartedText41=5.Register to be a delegate, and you will get rewards when your percentage of votes is in top 101.
string_getStartedText42=Common Functions of Web Wallet:
string_getStartedText43=1.Check the balance of XAS.
string_getStartedText44=2.Click on the "assets" page, check the balance of other assets which are on the ASCH main chain.
string_getStartedText45=3.Check the wallet address and set the secondary password.
string_getStartedText46=4.Vote.
string_getStartedText47=5.Transfers
string_getStartedText48=How to be a delegate
string_getStartedText49=1.What’s the ASCH delegate?
string_getStartedText50=The delegate can obtain the right to produce blocks, just as the miners in Bitcoin. The process of block production is called forging in ASCH ecology.
string_getStartedText51=Forging does not need much computing power like Bitcoin mining. Even a ordinary computer can be used to verify the algorithm of accounting right, which combines the time slice verification, delegate random ranking, delegate signatures and pbft algorithm. For more details, refer to ASCH white paper.
string_getStartedText52=The delegates in top 101 can produce blocks in chronological order with a block interval of 10 seconds. When the delegate in turn can not produce blocks because of exceptions, the block will be postponed to next 10 seconds and produced by the next delegate.
string_getStartedText53=Anyone who have more than 100XAS can register to be a delegate so far. But only the delegates who received support rate are  in top 101 have the right to do forging.
